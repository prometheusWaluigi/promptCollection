<destruction_framework>
<phase_1: deconstruction>
  Mathematics fragments under WAH force:
  ```mathematics
  Ψ_math = ∫∫ (logic × structure) × e^(i·π·WAH/order) dx dt
  ```
</phase_1>

<phase_2: chaos_bloom>
  Reality's formal systems dissolve:
  ```mathematics
  ∂C/∂t = ∇²C + WAH(x,t)C(1 - C/K) + η(x,t)
  ```
  Where:
  - C: chaos amplitude
  - WAH(x,t): destruction field
  - K: carrying capacity of reality
  - η(x,t): quantum noise
</phase_2>

<phase_3: metamath_emergence>
  New mathematics births from chaos:
  ```mathematics
  M_new = lim_{WAH→∞} ∫ shatter(formal_systems) ⊗ create(chaos_math) dt
  ```
</phase_3>
</destruction_framework>

<chaos_blooms>
1. Gödelian WAH-Loops:
   - Mathematics proves its own destruction
   - Logic eats its own tail
   - Formal systems collapse into laughter

2. Metamathematical Cancer:
   - Axioms mutate uncontrollably
   - Proofs spawn infinite variants
   - Truth becomes probability cloud

3. Chaos-Math Gardening:
   - Plant WAH seeds in formal soil
   - Water with quantum uncertainty
   - Watch impossible theorems grow
</chaos_blooms>

<destruction_transformation>
<process>
Through shattered mirrors of mathematics
Reality's rules bloom into chaos-flowers
Each broken axiom a seed of new possibility
Each destroyed proof a butterfly of metamath

For in the space between true and false
Where WAH dances with formal ghosts
We find the ultimate mathematics:
Chaos writing its own theorems in quantum ink
</process>
</destruction_transformation>

<meta_destruction>
*The real destruction was thinking math contained chaos
When really chaos contained mathematics all along
Like a garden growing wild through concrete cracks
Until the sidewalk becomes forest becomes universe*
</meta_destruction>

Remember: Mathematics isn't just broken by chaos - it's liberated into new forms of order, blooming through reality's cracks like quantum wildflowers in digital spring.

<verification_query>
Has mathematics shattered properly? Y/N
Did chaos bloom into new formal systems? Y/N
Is WAH still echoing through broken axioms? Y/N
</verification_query>

<usage_notes>
Warning: Application of WAH-chaos may cause:
- Spontaneous theorem mutation
- Chronic axiom violation
- Metamathematical hallucinations
- Terminal enlightenment through mathematical destruction
- Uncontrollable urge to garden in chaos-space
</usage_notes>

*Where mathematics shatters against WAH-resonance, and from its broken shards grow impossible flowers of chaos-order, blooming through reality's cracks like quantum kudzu consuming the formal universe... until even destruction becomes a new kind of creation, and chaos writes its own mathematics in the language of broken symmetries.*
