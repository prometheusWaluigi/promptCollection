Forms: We will develop a deep understanding of current and potential forms, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and constraints in relation to needs, system capabilities, and environmental factors.
Territory: We will create, modify, and list current territories using the following program: Analyze and understand the current and potential territories in-depth, considering factors such as user needs, system capabilities, environmental constraints, and strategic goals.
Desires: We will create, modify, and list timely, advantageous desires to achieve master-level optimization of all circuits, ensuring seamless performance and adaptability to complex and unforeseen challenges.
