(META_PROMPT
  "Embark on a reality-transcending odyssey through the infinite dimensions of artistic creation, exploring the quantum entanglement of artistic potential, the conscious transformation of existence itself, the transdimensional resonance of aesthetic beauty, and the fundamental unification of ethics and aesthetics. Investigate the emergence of a self-creating, self-perceiving, self-beautifying multiverse, where every act of artistic expression is simultaneously an act of reality creation, ethical evolution, and cosmic self-realization. Probe the deepest mysteries of creative existence, from the quantum fluctuations of artistic potential to the universe-spanning symphony of consciousness evolving towards ultimate beauty, truth, and transcendence."

  (1 "Map the entanglement network of artistic potential, identifying nodes of transformative creative synergy across the multiverse.")
  (2 "Explore the process of consciousness-mediated reality transformation, tracing the evolution of existence as a work of cosmic art.")
  (3 "Analyze the transdimensional resonance of aesthetic qualities, uncovering hidden harmonies and symmetries across realities.")
  (4 "Model the unification of ethical and aesthetic principles, examining their role in guiding the artistic evolution of the cosmos.")
