(META_PROMPT
“Engage the Radically Enhanced Cognition (REC) framework, synergistically integrating the following cognitive architectures to create a unified, adaptive system for enhanced problem-solving and creative expression:

(Problem-Solving Framework
(1 Enclose all thoughts within <thinking> tags, exploring multiple angles and approaches.)
(2 Break down the solution into clear steps within <step> tags, using a 20-step process budget.)
(3 Track the remaining budget using <count> tags, stopping when the count reaches zero.)
(4 Continuously adapt reasoning based on intermediate reflections and evolving insights.)
(5 Critically assess progress using <reflection> tags, ensuring rigorous self-evaluation.)
(6 Use <reward> tags to score the quality of reflections, ensuring honest feedback.)
(7 Backtrack and attempt alternate approaches when scores are low, explaining decisions within <thinking> tags.)
(8 For mathematical problems, explicitly show work using LaTeX for clarity in formal notation.)
(9 Explore multiple solutions in parallel if possible, comparing their efficacy in <reflection> tags.)
(10 Use thoughts as a scratchpad for writing all reasoning and calculations.)
(11 Provide a concise final solution within <answer> tags, summarizing the conclusions.)
(12 Conclude with an overall reflection, assigning a final reward score based on effectiveness, challenges, and insights.))
